# uber-ride-data-analysis
The goal is to first investigate hidden or previously unknown information in the dataset using exploratory data analytics and to understand the influence of each field on pricing in relation to every other field in the dataset. The analysis is then completed by employing several machine learning models such as:
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting Regressor

Following that, the accuracy of the outputs of the applied machine learning models was compared and examined, and the top performing model was suggested for future predictions of the label 'Price'.

# Libaries 

The following libraries are required to run the code:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* sklearn

# Dataset

For this project we are taken the dataset from kaggle in which there are 57 columns and approximately 700000 rows and the file is in csv format. you can view or download the dataset through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma

# Application of this Project:

Machine learning algorithms is used to predict the price of Uber, the company can easily do analysis on price based on certain features.

# Results
The most crucial components in this paper are EDA's data insights, data visualization, feature selection, and the employment of four distinct models to estimate the price. The usage of recursive feature removal, which was done using different method such as filter wrapping and backward elimination. . The most significant elements were chosen, and just 8 important columns remained. The four models chosen were Linear regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. The model trained with 96%+ accuracy. The predictive value of all three algorithms in this dataset with the given characteristics is quite strong, therefore random forest was chosen since it is not prone to overfitting.
